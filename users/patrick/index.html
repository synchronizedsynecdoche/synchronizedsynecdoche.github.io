            <h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>Hi, this is my page, but you likely already knew that. I'm currently taking a leave of abscence from my studies as an undergraduate student at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. I am majoring in Computer Science, and hope to add on a Mathematics major later on. My interests include *NIX like systems, cryptography and cryptographic systems, machine learning algorithms and applications, and applied cybersecurity. I hope to become more involved in CERIAS here at Purdue, and I hope to attend Graduate school for Mathematics after I obtain my B.Sc.</p>
				</br>
            <h3>Relevant Work Experience</h3>
			<p>I've worked at <a href="https://www.ivyhilltech.com/">IvyHill Technologies</a> in New Jersey as an interning applied security reseacher and then as a junior Drupal developer.</p>
				</br>
			<h3>Computer Science Skills</h3>
			<p>As of Fall 2017, I know basic Python, Java, PyCrypto (a Python2 module that supplies cryptographic primitives), Drupal, Linux, LaTeX, and have a working knowledge of PGP/GPG (see my key below!).</p>
				</br>

	<h3>Relevant Coursework</h3>
			<p> As of January 2018, I have taken Calculus I-III and CS180.</p>
				</br>
			<h3>Mathematics Interests</h3>
			<p>I enjoy learning about a broad range of topics, however I personally find topics relating to (Complex) Analysis and Algebraic Number Theory to be the most interesting!</p>
				</br>
			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<p>The first project I ever did was <a href="https://github.com/synchronizedsynecdoche/Cryptosnake">Cryptosnake</a>, a very small Python script that encrypted a user's string using AES in CBC mode with PBKDF2. I started creating a larger, more ambitious version of it that would fix some issues with the original version (such as not operating on bytes), but I haven't been working on it since school started. I also helped create a website for locating nearby charities at HackBCAIII alongside a group of 5 other people in 24 hours. I worked alongside Chris and Aditya at HackMIT to create ADBlockAR, an application that leverages Microsoft's HoloLens to remove advertisements in real life.</p>
				</br>
			<h3>Miscellaneous Facts</h3>
			<p>I enjoy kayaking and biking in my free time, and casually tutor high schoolers in an online AP Students community (I mainly help with Calculus BC and Computer Science).</p>
				</br>
            <h3>Contact</h3>
            <p>You can contact me at <a href="mailto:kelly237@purdue.edu" target="_blank">kelly237@purdue.edu</a>. I would prefer it if you used my <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xC9189A0E0E6D5443">PGP Key</a> to encrypt emails being sent to that address.</p>
